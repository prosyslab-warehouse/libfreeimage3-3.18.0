# FreeImage
FreeImage is an Open Source library to work with graphical file formats

This is one of dependencies of Moondust Project, TheXTech, and LunaLua.

# Differences from original
* This is a lite version which supports only BMP, PNG, GIF, JPEG, and ICO. The reason of removing support for other formats is unnecessaryness of them in our projects.
* All filepath-based functions are always accepting UTF-8 even on the Windows (original version receives ANSI or UTF16 paths on the Windows).

If you would like to have original version, you can visit the [official site of this library](http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/).
